Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping (GTSAM) documentation
===========================================

GTSAM is a library of C++ classes that implement smoothing and mapping (SAM) in robotics and vision, using factor graphs and Bayes networks as the underlying computing paradigm rather than sparse matrices. 

.. note::
   As of January 2023, the develop branch is officially in "Pre 4.3" mode. We envision several API-breaking changes as we switch to C++17 and away from boost.
